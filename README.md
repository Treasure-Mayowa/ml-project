# Skin Disease ML Model
This is a project I created alongside my 10-year old sister to teach her the basics of machine learning. She is interested in using technology in the medical field, so the project was along that line. This is a machine learning model that uses computer vision to determine which common skin disease a person has. It has a <90% accuracy.
